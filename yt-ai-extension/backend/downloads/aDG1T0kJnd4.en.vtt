00:00:01.803 --> 00:00:02.803
Thank you.

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:04.013
Thank you.

00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:10.484
So, my father used to always tell me something
which I want to share with you, that why do

00:00:10.484 --> 00:00:13.634
you want to fit inside a glass slipper?

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:18.394
You know, like we were told, like Cinderella
did, why do you want to fit inside a glass

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:22.754
slipper when you can shatter the glass ceiling?

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.233
I want to tell you a little secret.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:30.004
I'm not very fond of this phrase, breaking
the glass ceiling.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:31.274
Why does it annoy me?

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:34.973
Because it takes the context of everything
that I have done.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:41.884
All my achievements, all my hard work and
puts it into a box as if my ambition was that

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.943
I want to find a glass ceiling and break it.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.304
Not at all.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:50.854
To be really honest, I was never on a mission
to break, to shatter anything.

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:56.154
All I wanted was to chase my dreams, my ambitions.

00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:57.524
I wanted to evolve.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.264
I wanted to become the best version of me,
that I could be.

00:01:02.264 --> 00:01:05.804
And of course, in Priyanka Chopra style, along
the way, I wanted to smash and break every

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:09.973
obstacle that came my way, which I did.

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:12.973
But that does not mean that the glass ceiling
doesn't exist.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.973
Of course, it exists.

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:21.073
And countless of women and men, mostly women
run into it in their professional and personal

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:22.073
lives.

00:01:22.073 --> 00:01:25.694
And I'm sure a lot of you can vouch for that
right now.

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:33.603
The Oxford dictionary definition of the glass
ceiling is an unacknowledged barrier to advancement

00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:40.944
in a profession, especially affecting women
and members of minorities from rising beyond

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.933
a certain level in a hierarchy.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:48.944
And this metaphor was first coined by feminists
in reference to barriers in the careers of

00:01:48.944 --> 00:01:51.323
high achieving women.

00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:57.904
So, why did I choose it as my topic for today
if I hated it so much?

00:01:57.904 --> 00:02:04.624
Because I hope through my experiences, I can
present to you the tools to live your dream

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:12.144
and to not make that glass ceiling that is
defined by society, largely patriarchal, as

00:02:12.144 --> 00:02:13.953
your goal.

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:20.703
I want you to aim higher, because you know
you can, and it's honestly all I did.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:24.854
Every step of the way, all I did was set a
higher standard.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.604
How did I get here?

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:36.754
By being fierce, by being fearless, and by
being flawed, completely and utterly flawed.

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:38.254
I'm not perfect.

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:39.664
Like, none of us are.

00:02:39.664 --> 00:02:43.924
So, tonight I'm going to try and break it
down for you a little bit in a slightly different

00:02:43.924 --> 00:02:44.924
way.

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:50.823
I present the twelve sure shot, sure fireways
of becoming Priyanka Chopra.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.044
Would you like that?

00:02:52.044 --> 00:02:55.763
Sorry, I was just kidding.

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:59.123
Because as millennials, we don't like to be
told what to do.

00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:03.004
So, this is a gentle nudge in the right direction.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.343
Presenting PCs twelve rules of becoming the
best version of yourself.

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:10.934
So, here are a few of my favorites from my
list.

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:15.334
There's only one you, okay, because there's
no one like you.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:19.254
And I don't mean the superfluous, superficial
parts.

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:21.994
I'm talking about the core of you, who you
are inside.

00:03:21.994 --> 00:03:24.573
Your values, your beliefs, your flaws.

00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:31.584
And once you understand who really that person
is, you would have taken the first step in

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:33.513
finding your unique self.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:34.843
And that is the best version of you.

00:03:34.843 --> 00:03:37.153
Who am I really?

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:41.823
Most often, we don't allow ourselves the ability
to dream beyond our imagination.

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:46.184
We don't allow ourselves to think about the
future because we are afraid of change.

00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.154
We are afraid to move away from what is familiar.

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:54.203
Either that, or sometimes, you know, we are
too rigid to let our dreams evolve.

00:03:54.203 --> 00:03:58.823
Loosen up, you know, shake it off a little
bit.

00:03:58.823 --> 00:04:04.114
Change is the only constant thing in life,
and you are never too old or never too experienced

00:04:04.114 --> 00:04:06.744
to learn something new.

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:12.184
Believe that you have everything already as
your Brahmāstra in your will, to be able

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.294
to be and achieve your dreams.

00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:15.294
Be fearless.

00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:18.584
I know I wanted to become an aeronautical
engineer.

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:20.454
What am I today?

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:21.654
I'm an actor.

00:04:21.654 --> 00:04:22.744
I'm a singer.

00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:24.624
I'm an author.

00:04:24.624 --> 00:04:25.624
I'm a producer.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:26.624
I'm an artist.

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:29.124
How did I go from becoming an engineer to
all of these things?

00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:33.104
I made choices, the choices that I wanted
for myself.

00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:39.104
So, that is my rule number two, let your dreams
fly.

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:44.664
Give them wings, be who you want to be just
by being fearless.

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:48.824
Now, opportunities, that's another important
part of being fearless.

00:04:48.824 --> 00:04:52.514
They are very funny thing, these opportunities,
they don't come very often.

00:04:52.514 --> 00:04:55.633
They come far and few in between.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:58.454
But when they do, do we recognize them?

00:04:58.454 --> 00:05:02.714
Our job is to recognize them and make the
most of them.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:07.174
I look back on all the things that I've done,
and I marvel at the opportunities that came

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:08.484
my way.

00:05:08.484 --> 00:05:10.654
Miss India, Miss World.

00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:17.714
When I was in Bareli in army school, my first
film offer, my first music single, the first

00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:24.783
film I actually produced, there was never
a plan ever, more like the universe sort of

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:26.374
guiding me towards these opportunities.

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:32.504
All I had to do was recognize them and make
sure I worked so hard that I squeezed every

00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:34.473
drop out of these opportunities.

00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:37.454
This, ladies and gentlemen is called drive.

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:38.454
It's called ambition.

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:44.813
So, no matter where you are in life, rule
number three is you have never arrived enough

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:49.163
to explore new opportunities.

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:51.093
And there's nothing wrong with being ambitious.

00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:58.334
Ladies, listen to me.

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:04.144
Now for all of you guys who like everything
in life, I don't think there's anything wrong

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:09.044
with wanting to have the whole cake and eat
it too, nothing wrong.

00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:11.984
I want everything, I want everything.

00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:13.464
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:06:13.464 --> 00:06:18.883
As long as you're not harming someone or doing
something wrong, don't be scared to want more

00:06:18.883 --> 00:06:21.734
for yourself than you ever thought you could.

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:24.704
I'll give you a small example.

00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:31.314
A few years ago, I was shooting a film called
Don 2, you have heard of that, right?

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:36.544
So, it was chosen to be shown at the Berlin
Film Festival, Berlinale and my entire team

00:06:36.544 --> 00:06:38.394
was flying for the premiere.

00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:39.654
And it was very exciting time.

00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:44.593
But at the same time, I was invited for the
first time to attend the Grammy Awards in

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:45.794
LA.

00:06:45.794 --> 00:06:51.283
So, now when I was doing music, it was this
big choice, both the events were literally

00:06:51.283 --> 00:06:57.234
taking place one day apart in completely different
time zones, Berlin and LA.

00:06:57.234 --> 00:07:01.024
My team and everyone around me told me, no,
it can never happen.

00:07:01.024 --> 00:07:02.503
You have to choose what is your priority?

00:07:02.503 --> 00:07:09.873
And you know what I did, I made some insane
connections, Mumbai to London, London to Berlin,

00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:13.894
Berlin to Amsterdam, Amsterdam to LA, LA to
Mumbai in three days.

00:07:13.894 --> 00:07:19.374
And I made it happen.

00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:24.084
I went to both events and I looked great at
both events.

00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:28.973
Even though I hadn't slept, it took a little
bit of extra makeup, but I was fine.

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:30.484
And that's not the only time I've done it.

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:33.234
I've done it so many times over and over again.

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:34.234
Why?

00:07:34.234 --> 00:07:38.084
Because I don't want anyone to tell me I can't
have everything.

00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:40.913
I want to dream of everything, and I'll have
everything.

00:07:40.913 --> 00:07:44.114
So, rule number four, be greedy.

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.644
Be greedy for your ambitions.

00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:48.574
Be hungry for it.

00:07:48.574 --> 00:07:52.014
Don't live on someone else's benchmarks.

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:57.723
We are told so many times in our life: ‘No
girl should do this, or you are elder boy

00:07:57.723 --> 00:08:02.473
in house, your responsibility is this, this
is who you should be.’

00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:05.454
Who can tell you who you should be?

00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:10.934
Don't let anyone or any situation dictate
to you who you are and who you can be.

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.204
I know it's very much easier said than done.

00:08:13.204 --> 00:08:17.954
I know that because I've done it but fight
for your dreams because no one else is going

00:08:17.954 --> 00:08:20.944
to fight for your dreams, except you.

00:08:20.944 --> 00:08:25.663
I've turned down so many roles, opportunities
because they did not fit into what I thought

00:08:25.663 --> 00:08:28.424
at that time was the right thing for me.

00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:31.984
So, today my path is just my own.

00:08:31.984 --> 00:08:33.804
It belongs to no one.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:38.143
My failures, my successes, all of it, mine,
my journey, all of it is mine.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:42.754
So, rule number five, do not compromise.

00:08:42.754 --> 00:08:46.724
Do not settle on your dreams.

00:08:46.724 --> 00:08:48.114
Now who likes to fail?

00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:56.144
What, what, at least 15 people raised their
hands, I'm really confused with this audience

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:57.874
right now.

00:08:57.874 --> 00:09:00.304
And you like to fail, well I'm not talking
to you guys then.

00:09:00.304 --> 00:09:05.504
I'm talking to those guys who hate to fail
because I hate to fail.

00:09:05.504 --> 00:09:10.274
It's really as simple as that, it takes tubs
and tubs of ice cream, lots of tissues, lots

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:15.604
of tears, lots of dramebazi, my mother, my
best friends, my family, everybody making

00:09:15.604 --> 00:09:17.324
me feel better about it.

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:22.674
But the one thing that is as certain as night
and day, ladies and gentlemen, is that you

00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:25.323
will fail.

00:09:25.323 --> 00:09:27.583
It's just how it is.

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:32.333
And there's nothing that you can do to stop
that.

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:37.484
It's what you do after that will define where
you go.

00:09:37.484 --> 00:09:39.694
When something I've invested...

00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:45.453
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:49.994
When something I've invested in my heart and
my soul, which I do with everything that I

00:09:49.994 --> 00:09:57.424
actually put my mind to, if that fails, I
don't just wallow in self-pity.

00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:59.234
I roll myself in it.

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:00.744
I roll around in it.

00:10:00.744 --> 00:10:07.114
I wrap myself in it, head to toe, self-pity,
self-pity, self-pity, it's not a pretty sight,

00:10:07.114 --> 00:10:08.514
I can tell you that.

00:10:08.514 --> 00:10:11.874
My mother who's sitting right here has witnessed
it many times.

00:10:11.874 --> 00:10:18.784
But then I get up, cry a little, dust myself
off and dive straight back into life.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:27.323
Because the only way to push failure aside
is to move ahead, not ignore it, analyze it

00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:28.893
and learn from it.

00:10:28.893 --> 00:10:35.414
Always remember, you will never truly enjoy
success until you have tasted failure.

00:10:35.414 --> 00:10:40.474
And trust me when I tell you, it tastes like
shit, really does.

00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:47.164
So, rule number six, fail, fail, fail again,
and then rise like a Phoenix.

00:10:47.164 --> 00:10:49.744
Now what is life without a little bit of a
risk, right?

00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:51.564
No, I'm not an adrenaline junkie.

00:10:51.564 --> 00:10:54.333
I'm not telling you to go off roller coasters
or anything.

00:10:54.333 --> 00:11:01.474
I've always believed that you have to take
risks, calculated, educated risks to evolve.

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:05.874
Because if you've not truly explored the full
extent of your possibilities, you'll always

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:08.414
remain stagnant.

00:11:08.414 --> 00:11:12.594
People have written me off several times in
my career.

00:11:12.594 --> 00:11:15.083
Sometimes they didn't agree with my choices.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:20.124
When I played a negative character in my film
Aitraaz, very early in my career, I was told

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:22.944
I'll be a vamp and no one will cast me as
a heroine.

00:11:22.944 --> 00:11:29.383
When I took on a female centric film called
Fashion, again, very early on in my career,

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:31.914
I was told that was not norm.

00:11:31.914 --> 00:11:38.833
When I signed a US TV show at the height of
my film career in India, each time the risks

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:46.754
were huge, the stakes were high and the repercussions
could have been, to say not the least, career

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:47.954
ending.

00:11:47.954 --> 00:11:50.724
Thank God they weren't and I'm still standing
in front of you.

00:11:50.724 --> 00:11:53.124
I really appreciate God.

00:11:53.124 --> 00:11:54.804
I don't know what will happen going forward.

00:11:54.804 --> 00:11:59.874
But as of now, I can say that my risks and
the gamble was worth it.

00:11:59.874 --> 00:12:01.674
You know why?

00:12:01.674 --> 00:12:05.513
Because I backed up those risks with my hundred
percent.

00:12:05.513 --> 00:12:11.544
So, rule number seven, be bold and take these
risks.

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:19.464
Now, friends, family, the people you work
with, the people around us are our greatest

00:12:19.464 --> 00:12:22.314
influences in your journey to success.

00:12:22.314 --> 00:12:24.874
So, you have to choose very wisely.

00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:30.874
Rule number eight, surround yourself with
the right people, who do not stab you in the

00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:33.154
back.

00:12:33.154 --> 00:12:34.434
Now who's into Social Media.

00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:35.914
Who's on social media.

00:12:35.914 --> 00:12:37.854
Raise your hands.

00:12:37.854 --> 00:12:39.114
Yeah, we like it.

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:40.114
I like it.

00:12:40.114 --> 00:12:41.534
We can raise our hands.

00:12:41.534 --> 00:12:43.234
Alright, it's almost everyone.

00:12:43.234 --> 00:12:48.104
Now keep your hands raised if you have ever
been upset by like a bad comment that you

00:12:48.104 --> 00:12:52.544
may have read on a photograph or like on Facebook
or when you have posted something.

00:12:52.544 --> 00:12:55.434
And sometimes, you know, you are just like,
why do people have to be mean?

00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:56.434
Yeah.

00:12:56.434 --> 00:12:58.354
So, there's a lot of you, right.

00:12:58.354 --> 00:13:01.344
Guys, please let me just tell you this.

00:13:01.344 --> 00:13:12.004
No matter what you do, someone will always
be unhappy.

00:13:12.004 --> 00:13:13.824
Always.

00:13:13.824 --> 00:13:18.204
Especially in this age of social media, it's
so easy for us to be confused between the

00:13:18.204 --> 00:13:24.434
voices that actually matter, and the opinions
of faceless people writing behind the anonymity

00:13:24.434 --> 00:13:26.514
of what the web offers.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.234
They don't matter.

00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:37.124
So, rule number nine, you can never please
everyone all the time.

00:13:37.124 --> 00:13:44.734
And the biggest favour that you will all do
to yourselves will be to laugh, at yourself,

00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:46.864
at situations.

00:13:46.864 --> 00:13:52.294
Find a moment to appreciate every single day,
this funny thing called life.

00:13:52.294 --> 00:13:57.484
And that's my most important rule number ten,
don't take yourself too seriously.

00:13:57.484 --> 00:13:58.774
We're not making rockets.

00:13:58.774 --> 00:14:01.904
Alright, calm down, have fun.

00:14:01.904 --> 00:14:05.434
And just enjoy this beautiful journey that
we've been put on.

00:14:05.434 --> 00:14:09.244
I do that.

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:11.074
In the meanwhile, hi.

00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:16.244
I am here, not going anywhere, two rules are
still left.

00:14:16.244 --> 00:14:27.114
It's really not that hard in my experience
to be kind, to be compassionate, to be human.

00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:29.964
You will never know someone else's full story.

00:14:29.964 --> 00:14:31.854
So, don't be quick to judge.

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:36.864
My mother who's here tonight with the rest
of my family, this entire front row is very

00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:42.354
Chopra and Akhori right now.

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:48.154
She taught me when I was very, very young,
that there is always someone who will be less

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:51.984
fortunate than you, always.

00:14:51.984 --> 00:14:57.054
So, give back wherever you can.

00:14:57.054 --> 00:15:03.263
There's a huge reason I started my foundation,
I lend my voice to UNICEF, Girl Up and causes

00:15:03.263 --> 00:15:10.443
that I'm associated with, because we have
one world and it's ours and we need to heal

00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:11.443
it.

00:15:11.443 --> 00:15:15.054
And that starts with us.

00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:22.703
So, that is my rule number eleven, give back.

00:15:22.703 --> 00:15:28.344
And finally, the most important one, always
remember where you came from.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:29.704
It's truly what defines you.

00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:35.924
So, I'm a proud Indian and army's daughter.

00:15:35.924 --> 00:15:44.744
Daughter of two doctors with a middle-class
upbringing and ginormous families, who I love

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:47.794
on both sides.

00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:50.023
We've seen good times; we've seen bad times.

00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:55.273
We've seen hardships, we've seen pain, laughter,
sadness, but that is what has made me who

00:15:55.273 --> 00:15:56.273
I am.

00:15:56.273 --> 00:15:59.424
And I wear that with pride every day and everywhere
that I go.

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:04.753
So, last and definitely not the least, rule
number twelve, don't ever forget your roots

00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:12.214
and where you came from.

00:16:12.214 --> 00:16:16.974
I hope you take some of what I have shared
with you today and go into the new year with

00:16:16.974 --> 00:16:25.034
maybe a different perspective on life and
start 2018 with being fierce, fearless, and

00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:26.034
flawed.

00:16:26.034 --> 00:16:27.034
Yeah, that's it.

00:16:27.034 --> 00:16:29.813
That's it.

00:16:29.813 --> 00:16:33.844
I read this somewhere and it kind of stuck
with me and I hope it will stick with you.

00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:40.245
Life's journey is not to arrive at your grave
site safely, in a well-preserved body, but

00:16:40.245 --> 00:16:47.084
rather to skid in sideways, completely worn
out and say, holy shit, that was a ride.

00:16:47.084 --> 00:16:50.523
That is how I want to go.

00:16:50.523 --> 00:16:57.934
So, to sum up this incredible journey that
I have been on, I stand before you today,

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:03.434
weathered by life, but happy and raring to
do so much more.

00:17:03.434 --> 00:17:05.514
I'll see you on the other side.

00:17:05.514 --> 00:17:05.924
Namaste.
